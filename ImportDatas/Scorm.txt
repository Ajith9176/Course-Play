SCORM stands for Sharable Content Object Reference Model.Sharable Content Object indicates that SCORM is all about creating units of online training material that can be shared across systems. 
SCORM defines how to create “sharable content objects” or “SCOs” that can be reused in different systems and contexts.“Reference Model” reflects the fact that SCORM isn’t actually a standard.
 ADL didn’t write SCORM from the ground up.
 Instead, they noticed that the industry already had many standards that solved part of the problem. 
SCORM simply references these existing standards and tells developers how to properly use them together.
